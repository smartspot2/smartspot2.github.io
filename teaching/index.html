  <h5>CS 70 uGSI</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Spring 2022:</b>
      <p>
        As a returning undergraduate student instructor for CS70 in the spring,
        I continued to teach 2 one-hour discussion sections to groups of around 35 people.
        This semester, I was also on the content team on course staff,
        responsible for creating homeworks and discussion worksheets,
        and creating additional problems for the course as well.
        Further, I was also responsible for refactoring the
        <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        in the course notes; I made the source code more conventional,
        while also typesetting new diagrams purely in
        <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        for the notes to increase clarity and cohesiveness.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Fall 2021:</b>
      <p>
        As a returning undergraduate student instructor for CS70 in the fall,
        I taught 2 one-hour discussion sections to groups of 35-40 people,
        and held 2 hours of office hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some of my free time, I re-wrote (and re-typeset) the solutions
        to the Fall 2020 Final, as the original were quite unclear and confusing to students
        (from experience over the summer with students coming to my office hours).
        Here is the link to the pdf:

    <li>
      <b>Summer 2021:</b>
      <p>
        As an undergraduate student instructor for CS70 in the summer,
        I taught 4 one-hour discussion sections to groups of approximately 10 people,
        and held 4 hours of office hours to students who had questions.
        Additionally, I helped modify existing scripts to automatically create
        homework <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        templates for students to utilize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some extra problems I created along with a couple other TAs;
        we released short practice worksheets every week as a "Problems of the Week".

  <h5>CSM 70</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Spring 2021:</b>
      <p>
        As a mentor for UC Berkeley's Computer Science Mentors,
        I led 2 one-hour small group tutoring sections every week for around 6 students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some supplemental documents I created for CSM 70 in Spring 2021.
        The CS70 course notes are excellent material to use just by themselves,
        but I've provided these documents just as another way of looking at certain topics,
        giving a different kind of explanation for them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../assets/pdf/Week3_EGCD_CRT.pdf" target="_blank">
          Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Chinese Remainder Theorem
        </a></li>
        <li><a href="../assets/pdf/Week5_ECC.pdf" target="_blank">
          Error Correcting Codes
        </a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, I've compiled a table of common distributions covered in CS70,
        along with some potentially useful tips and facts for working with the various distributions.
      </p>
